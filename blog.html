                    <p>There are three keywords in JavaScript that can be used to declare variables: let, var, and
                        const. Each keyword has different rules and implications for how the variables they create can
                        be used. <br>

                        <b> let:</b> The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it
                        to a
                        value.
                        Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in,
                        which is usually denoted by curly braces {}. <br>

                        <b> var:</b> The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally
                        initializing it
                        to a value.
                        Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared
                        in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code. <br>

                        <b>const:</b> The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a
                        variable
                        that can’t be reassigned.
                        Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are
                        actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.

                    </h3>
                    <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and
                        callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword.
                        However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can
                        never be used as constructor functions.Regular functions created using function declarations or
                        expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can
                        be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not
                        constructible. Thus, we will get a run-time error on trying to construct a non-constructible
                        arrow functions using the new keyword.</p>

                    <p>Array functions are something that can help you with any type of manipulation or looping through
                        an array of items in JavaScript. Function .forEach() is another form of just a plain for loop
                        that can be used to iterate through array items. This case of a function is used for more
                        complex arrays, for example, an array of objects with a lot of entries than just an array of
                        integers.Function .map() is a manipulative function that can modify each element’s content in an
                        array that it is called on. This function returns a new array with modified values, the array
                        that it is called on will stay still. Function .filter() is a search function that returns all
                        the elements that fulfil the assigned condition.Function .find() is also a search function like
                        the previous but they differ in one small detail — this function returns only one match in an
                        array.</p>

                    <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                        insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in
                        older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain
                        dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are
                        functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great
                        for converting strings to different entities.Template literals are literals delimited with
                        backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string interpolation with embedded
                        expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.</p>
